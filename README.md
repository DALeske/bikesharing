## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze NY CitiBike bike rental statistics in an effort to justify opening a similar business in the Des Moines, Iowa area. Rider characteristics and ride patterns are analyzed.

## Summary of Results
Based on analysis, the following observations were made:
-Most riders are between the ages of 23 and 41 years
-Most riders are male
-Most rides are under 30 minutes
-Gender does not appear to alter the pattern of ridership.
-The majority of rides are from subscribed riders
-Subscribed riders ride most frequently during the commute hours during weekdays
-Walk-up customers most often ride on weekends
-Weekend riders appear to ride slightly longer than subscribed riders

## Conclusions
Most subscribers use the bike shares as a way to commute to work, but will utilize them on the weekends as well. Weekend and middle of the day ridership is primarily from walk-up customers, quite possibly individuals or families on vacation.

## Future Analysis
A detailed analysis will need to be done to compare the demographics of people in the Des Moines metro area with those in the NYC metro.  In addition, a collaboration with the Department of Travel and Tourism in the Des Moines area could help inform the potential for weekend and middle of the day ridership.
